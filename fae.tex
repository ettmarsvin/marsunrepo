\chapter{Factors affecting experimentation} \label{faetheory}
This chapter provides consensus of factors that affect experimentation behaviour.  Experimentation as a method for learning and developing has not yet been widely studied, yet creativity and learning skills of an individual have been related to willingness and ability to conduct experiments. Thus, in this chapter, theories from research fields such as organisational behaviour, leadership and management, creativity, innovation and prototyping are combined. 

In the first section supporting environment for experimenting is presented, outlining how psychological safety, tolerating risk and learning from failure are all essential for experimentation behaviour. Then, the second section outlines team perspective towards development, including low hierarchy, clear and fair communication and team engagement. Current trend in research shows leaders and their behaviour have great influence on the creativity and innovation ability of employees \citep{mumford2002leading,jung2001transformational,amabile1998kill}. Thus, the last section presents how leadership behaviour affects on employees' willingness and abilities to conduct experiments.

Only through understanding factors affecting experimentation behaviour can experimenting be supported in organisations. 

\section{Supporting environment for experimenting}
\citet{mumford1988creativity} have studied the gap between an idea an action, and revealed it depending on various attributes related to individual and organisational circumstances. Experimenting requires creative actions and willingness to solve problems, thinking out of the box and challenge status quo. When employees feel they are working in supporting working environment, level of creativity and ability find novel approaches and try out new things increases. \citep{shalley2004leaders} In addition, study of \citet{oldham1996employee} show how creative individuals may only produce more creative outputs than less creative individuals when the context is supporting and encouraging towards creativity. Thus, environment should be designed to support and facilitate these skills. These environmental variables include for instance providing resources to stimulate fresh ideas and clear and sufficient interaction between team members and management \citep{mumford1988creativity,shalley2004leaders}. 

As physical work environment affects on creativity, information sharing and innovation in an organisation, it should be designed to support the natural flow of traffic through the building so that informal conversations between different functional areas are enabled \citep{shalley2004leaders}. According to \citet{edmondson1996learning} supportive organisational context consists of access to sufficient amount of resources, information, training, rewards and management coaching. Proactive learning behaviour is related to all above mentioned \citep{edmondson2003speaking}. 

Furthermore, organisational climate has to support and encourage innovation \citep{mumford1988creativity,amabile1998kill} by valuing initiative and innovative approaches that support employees in risk-taking, accepting challenging assignments and stimulate intrinsic motivation towards work \citep{jung2003role}.

Experimenting seem to require safe and supportive environment, in which an individual feels psychologically safe, where uncertainty is tolerated and failures accepted as a part of the development process. In this section these aspects are described in more detail.  

\subsection{Psychological safety} \label{psychologicalsafety}
Organisations exist in which people do ask help, admit errors, discuss about problems and are willing to conduct experiments. In these environments employees seem to perceive interpersonal threat low enough to perform despite of the threat. Some studies argue familiarity among group members is likely to encourage openness towards new information and ideas \citep{sanna1990valence}, yet this alone is not sufficient to explain when group members find it safe to act instead of feeling threatened \citep{edmondson1999psychological}. \citet{edmondson1999psychological} has studied working environments and realised in environments employees act despite the threat, they feel safe and supported for their actions. She refers to this as psychological safety, which serves as a mechanism that assists in explaining how structural and interpersonal characteristics both have effects on learning and performance in teams (ibid).  

Trust has been widely noted in research as an essential factor in organisational teams and groups to act\citep{golembiewski1975centrality,kramer1999trust,shalley2004leaders,edmondson1999psychological}. Trust refers to one's willingness to be vulnerable in his actions as he expects his actions will not be judged and will be favourable to one's interests \citep{robinson1997corporate}. Interpersonal trust is involved in psychological safety, yet it also includes perception of mutual respect and overall climate where team members feel free to be themselves \citep{edmondson1999psychological}. 

Psychological safety of employees can be increased for instance through great teams and teamwork \citep{edmondson1999psychological}. Team psychological safety consists of team members' shared belief towards interpersonal risk-taking, coming up with new ideas and breaking the status-quo. Employee's willingness to take interpersonal risks depends highly on the experience of team safety and person's beliefs how others will respond in ideas or situations involving uncertainty. \citep{edmondson1999psychological,farson2002failuretolerantleader} When knowing that well-intentioned interpersonal risks are not punished is a shared belief of a team, team members are more likely to take proactive actions essential for experimenting \citep{garvin2008yours}.

Accordingly, \citet{amabile1998kill} suggested when employees are encouraged to tell their ideas out loud freely and without judging, idea exchange and discussion about them increase. In addition, the sense of clarity and safety of employees at workplace is increased through clearly elaborated expectations, evaluation methods and rewards. Furthermore, sense of being treated fairly is essential for willingness to conduct experiments. \citep{shalley2004leaders}

Furthermore, psychological safety can be fostered through structural factors such as context support and team leader coaching \citep{hackman1987design,edmondson1999psychological}. Context support refers for instance to access to information and resources needed. Safe environment that fosters creativity also takes into account employees' perceptions of just and transparent decision-making as well as applied actions \citep{shalley2004leaders}. Climate of safety and supportiveness encourages employees to seek for feedback and ask for help in addition to admit and reflect mistakes. \citep{edmondson1999psychological} 

According to \citet{lee2004mixed} in order to foster innovation, organisational conditions should be regarded from a broad, holistic perspective. Inconsistency among organisational conditions stands a as threat for employee's behaviour. For instance, willingness to conduct experiments reduces when some part of the organisation or managers encourage experimentation and others do not. (ibid)

In psychologically safe environment uncertainty is not totally avoided but managed and tolerated \citep{shalley2004leaders}. What follows is detailed description of how essential tolerating risk and uncertainty is. 

\subsection{Tolerating risk and uncertainty}
\textit{"We love innovation and we urge for innovation, but we can tolerate it only if it is controllable and results everything remaining the same".} \citep{quinn1985managing}
\newline

When dealing with novel solutions and challenging status quo, we are dealing with innovations that include risk-taking. Concurrently conventional management processes avoid risk-taking and focus on managing daily routine business. \citep{quinn1985managing} However, in his study \citet{nystrom1990organizational} found that organisational culture reflecting challenge and risk taking lead to more innovative actions of employees and the whole organisation. Creative actions require several trial-and-error, iterative, experimentation processes \citep{shalley2004leaders}. 
However, when fearing risk-taking and uncertainty, individuals stick to routines and prefer more certain outcomes and ways of performing  \citep{bazerman2012judgment,shalley2004leaders}. 

The phenomenon of threat and embarrassment of employees in organisations is widely studied and consensus is rising how threat effects on cognitive and behavioural flexibility and responsibility in reducing manner. \citep{argyris1982reasoning,edmondson1999psychological,staw1989tradeoff} An employee is likely to inhibit trying novel approaches as a result of fear of being rejected, under pressure or placing himself at risk \citep{edmondson1999psychological}. This is likely even though their transparency and honesty would be highly important for the behaviour of the team \citep{argyris1982reasoning, edmondson1999psychological}. This may occur in a situation where an employee should ask for help, yet is afraid of appearing incompetent or giving unfavourable impressions on people who have the power to give promotions, raises or who assigns projects. \citep{edmondson1999psychological,brown1990politeness}. 

Also according to \citet{brown1990politeness} admitting mistakes, asking for help and seeking feedback are all relevant abilities for experimenting, yet threatening for an individual's image of himself and his skills. Ambiguity is often perceived by individuals when lacking sufficient cues to structure a situation, and usually arises from novelty, complexity or unsolvability of a situation at hand \citep{budner1962intolerance}. However, these are all characteristics related to experimentation \citep{tuulenmaki2011art}. 

As predicting the future is impossible, uncertainty should not be considered only as a threat or inconvenience occurring in organisations. Rather should appropriate level of messiness let exist, not overly controlled, and develop opportunities where uncertainty can be exploited. \citep{sternberg1997creativity} Level of uncertainty can be reduced for instance through goal-setting and fast prototyping \citep{mumford2002leading}. \citet{kanter1983change} emphasises opportunities actually grow from uncertainty and creative endeavours rise when struggling with uncertainty and messiness, as individuals impose order where it does not exist, and are thus forced to form new connections. 

According to \citet{andriopoulos2000enhancing} facing and dealing with risk serves also as positive boost to creativity, as employees learn new skills, strengthen their capabilities constantly and adapt new knowledge to already known. Also \citet{mumford1988creativity} argue feeling of self-efficacy may affect individual's willingness to provide unique and novel ideas even when some degree of risk is involved. This, however, requires safe environment which \citet{andriopoulos2000enhancing} refer to a safety net: environment that tolerates failure. Bank of America, an example described in section \ref{expeinnovation}, got to notice how staff turnover in experimentation laboratories dropped considerably during the experimenting period. Even though employees faced difficulties and had to tolerate risks and uncertainties, they felt engaged and enthusiastic during the test period.  \citep{thomke2003r}

Furthermore, inconsistent organisational conditions tend to prevent experimentation behaviour. In their study \citet{lee2004mixed} found that in uncertain and unpredictable situations, employees under high evaluative pressure were likely to become uncertain, rigid and narrowly focused, leading decrease in psychological safety. In turn, employees under less evaluative pressure turned out more tolerant for taking risks, thinking optimistically, working more proactively and willing to conduct experiments. (ibid) Thus, human resource practices should be in line and systematically linked together in order to create a clear picture for employees of what is expected of them \citep{shalley2004leaders}. 

In creative work risk concerns both the need to do experiments and tolerate failure \citep{andriopoulos2000enhancing,quinn1985managing}, as failing is widely considered as essential part of learning \citep{farson2002failuretolerantleader}. Thus, employees should be allowed to conduct experiments despite of the outcome \citep{jung2003role}. Next section outlines how the attitude towards failures should shift to positive. 

\subsection{Failures as opportunities for growth} \label{failures}
Applying experimentation-driven approach requires rethinking the role of failure in organisations. According to various studies, failing and negative consequences are natural part of creative, innovation and learning processes \citep{hennessey19881,shalley2004leaders,andriopoulos2000enhancing}. Indeed, the learnings companies gain from large-scale pilots could be achieved with smaller tests that save resources \citep{anderson2011step}.

Also \citet{lee2004mixed} argue experimentation behaviour being essential for innovation and failures being inevitable for the process. For instance, \citet{hennessey19881} emphasise negative consequences belong to a process, and in the concept of perpetual challenging of \citet{andriopoulos2000enhancing}, adventuring phase includes making mistakes. Likewise,\citet{edmondson1999psychological} relates experimenting tightly to failing emphasise being on team learning. 

\citet{garvin2008yours} divide organisational failure into three categories: unsuccessful trials, system break-downs and process deviations. In this thesis, unsuccessful trials refer to failures in experimenting. Failure can disclose important information and reveal gaps in knowledge, and is thus important in as early phase of the development process as possible. \citep{buijs2007innovation,thomke2001enlightened} Also \citet{sitkin1992learning} emphasises how failures facilitate innovation and performance through new knowledge, which narrows the scope of following experiments. According to \citet{thomke2001enlightened}, this is not an usual way for an organisation to think about failure, thus building the capacity for rapid experimentation as well as tolerating and learning from failure is essential and often requires overcoming ingrained attitudes. When growth of a company usually leads to more conservative actions and increase in fear of failure. When fearing failure managers tend to deny failure and erase it from the memory instead of learning from it. \citep{amabile2008creativity}. 

In turn, according to \citet{farson2002failuretolerantleader} currently succeeding companies even thrive for failure in order to learn fast and find the best practices and business models. For instance, credit company Capital One conducts continually large amount of market experiments. They know most of the tests will not pay off, yet they also know how much can be learned about customers and markets from failed tests in early phase of development. \citep{farson2002failuretolerantleader}

According to \citet{thomke2003r} the most radical experiments provide the greatest learnings, yet they concurrently have the highest level of risk and thus high probability to fail. In laboratory settings allowing experiments to fail and still producing valuable insights is accepted. When brought to real life, employees tend to fear alienating customers or alienating top management who have the power to prevent further development. Conducting experiments in live settings may cause distraction for both customers and employees: customers may be confused by new processes and employees find it difficult to adapt to new routines. In addition, live experiments are in risk to hurt the brand and are oftentimes difficult and resource-consuming to execute and measure.\citep{thomke2003r}

While these risks remain real, they have to be weighted carefully and the benefits and insights experiments and failures can provide considered. Experiments concerning service development remain most useful when conducted in real life circumstances, as the feedback is instant and customer transactions real. (ibid) Also according to \citet{quinn1985managing} engaging lead customers in the interactive development process instead of market research seems to elucidate more relevant information about customer's demands, required changes and entry strategies. In the example of Bank of America, in only few years had they gained essential benefits that had real impact on business. \citep{thomke2003r}

While failed experiments offer valuable opportunities for growth, issues about safety and health of people participating experiments need to be taken into account \citep{farson2002failuretolerantleader}. Furthermore, according to \citet{thomke2001enlightened}, failures produce most value, when the experiment is well planned and the goal or hypothesis that needs to be tested is clear. 

Failing as a personal matter remains a difficult subject, as failing never feels exceptionally great, and often employees still consider failed work as failing personally \citep{farson2002failuretolerantleader}. Especially in psychologically unsafe environments, interpersonal costs of failure may easily be exaggerated: employees are afraid how their need for help or gaps in knowledge become salient to colleagues or managers \citep{lee1997going}. Thus, conditions supporting psychological safety are likely to reduce fear of failure and encourage experimentation \citep{lee2004mixed}.

When failures are being punished through reward systems, the cost of experimentation increases and makes employees less willing to conduct experiments \citep{thomke2001enlightened}.\citet{lee2004mixed} found that individuals are more likely to conduct experiments when being rewarded, and when rewards do not penalise for failures. 

Studies show how nominal groups perform remarkably better in ideation and brainstorming processes by producing greater amount of ideas than real groups \citep{jung2001transformational,sosik1998transformational}. This may be due to the learnt practices and norms of a real work group, fear of failure that prevents free idea exchange and fear of evaluation and others judgement when suggesting creative solutions. Overall, oftentimes employees find it difficult to take a different role and actions in group with familiar members and routines. \citep{jung2001transformational}

Thus, team's tolerance for imperfection and error should be increased \citep{edmondson1999psychological}. According to \citet{thomke2001enlightened} this can be done for instance through brainstorming sessions where judgement is not allowed. Also \citet{garvin2008yours} states by creating an environment that serves psychological safety for employees, organisations may capitalise on failure. Safe environment does not humiliate or punish employees for failing or coming up with novel ideas or doubts. \citet{garvin2008yours, de2001minority,amabile2008creativity, amabile1996assessing} Also according to \citet{edmondson1996learning} employees are less hesitant to discuss mistakes when normative values of the organisation and work group assure that failures are allowed and even expected part of developing and learning. 

\section{Team perspective and engagement}
In order to create new value and competitive advantage in rapidly changing and uncertain organisational environments, new managerial imperative is growing, focusing on teams. Supporting teams in their work and understanding the aspects of learning is also required in experimenting \citep{edmondson1999psychological}. According to \citet{monge1992communication} group communication is likely to increase innovation under some circumstances, and also \citet{katzenbach1993wisdom} argues for culture of strong team performance. According to \citet{amabile1996assessing} team can support and improve individuals' ability and willingness to aim for creative actions. 

As presented in chapter \ref{teamperformance}, teams that are able to learn are better at solving problems, confronting challenging situations, observe changes in environment and customer requirements. In the theory of \citet{edmondson1999psychological} on team learning, factors essential for learning are similar to essential factors for experimenting. These include transparent information sharing, asking for help, receiving and giving feedback, tolerating failures and discussing about them in order to reflect experiments and improve work. \citep{edmondson1999psychological}

As individuals oftentimes require support and input from several individuals who help to challenge ideas in constructive ways, teams are essential in generating and implementing ideas \citep{mumford2002social}. Stimulating those constructive individuals for creative actions may be valuable \citep{robinson1997corporate}. In addition, including team members in ideation assists in idea implementation and through participation new ideas are not that likely to be rejected or abandoned \citep{agrell1994team}. Through brainstorming activities focus on non-traditional thinking and fantasising intellectual skills of employees can be enhanced \citep{sosik1998transformational}.

The composition of the team matters. Studies have shown how team performance, especially related to innovation, is improved when team consists of individuals with various and different set of skills and characteristics \citep{buijs2007innovation}. Homogeneity in teams easily leads to groupthink, routine work and repeating traditional daily practices, while even one or two different individuals can stimulate the innovativeness of a team. Actually, the outcasts and those who stand out from the group are required in order to think outside the box, challenge the status quo and present alternative solutions and ideas that would be missing without the participations of these individuals. \citep{sternberg1997creativity} However, according to \citet{quinn1985managing} especially larger companies tend to hold tight on their conventional opinion how enthusiastic employees who challenge the status quo are likely to cause embarrassment and troubles for organisation.

Also \citet{janis1982groupthink} refers to social cohesion, which may inhibit innovativeness of the team and its individuals especially beyond a moderate level, while employees are more likely to settle on group think and traditional daily practices . However, according to the study of \citet{sethi2001cross} a team sharing a superordinate identity, being encouraged to take risks, letting customer's requirements be heard, and actively letting senior management monitor the project, team is more likely to present innovative ideas and perform in innovative ways. According to this study, functional diversity does not effect on innovativeness, but team's superordinate identity can be strengthened by encouraging risk-taking and weakened by social cohesion. (ibid)

Communication of ideas among team has been widely recognised being related to idea generation, creativity and innovation\citep{robinson1997corporate,mumford2002social,monge1992communication,amabile1996assessing}. According to \citet{staw1989tradeoff} social influence of others plays a major role for individuals' beliefs; attitudes towards job, for instance, rise from the social labelling of work by others.  Also \citet{salancik1978social} argue the essential role opinions of others may have on individual: individual's perception of her work and organisation can be greatly influenced by opinions of others. 

Study of \citet{sethi2001cross} showed how good interaction in a team and high level of commitment to the success of the team lead to more radical innovation abilities. In the study team members were highly encouraged to take risks, which lead to more motivated members in suggesting novel ideas from their perspectives. In addition, team members identified themselves strongly as part of the team, which again lead to higher commitment level. \citep{sethi2001cross}

In addition, in order to function team needs a clear purpose and vision what makes it a team and why it exists \citep{katzenbach1993wisdom} and according to \citet{thomke2001enlightened} the whole team understanding the meaning of experimenting and developing forms a basis for team engagement. Teams get energy from significant performance challenges regardless of where they are in the organisation. Set of shared, demanding performance goals usually form a team, and personal chemistry or willingness to form a team may boost that.  \citep{katzenbach1993wisdom}

Thus, in order to receive great results teams should focus on performance regardless of the organisational hierarchy or what team does \citep{katzenbach1993wisdom}. Team performance may exceed the results of what could be achieved if employees were acting alone as individuals without the team effort \citep{katzenbach1993wisdom}. \citet{thomke2001enlightened} argues how small project teams together with parallel experimenting serves efficient especially when time is the most critical factor.

\section{Experimentation design and practicalities}
\textit{"Since it takes a chain of yeses and only one no to kill a project, jeopardy multiplies as management layers increase."} \citep{quinn1985managing}
\newline

When planning and conducting experiments, several factors from communication of ideas, time and team management and setting goals for experiments should be taken into account in order to gain valuable insights from experiments with reasonable amount of resources. Strong hierarchy and heavy bureaucracy are likely to hinder experimentation whereas autonomy of employees and shared goals and good communication of ideas essential for it. 

According to \citet{quinn1985managing} although goals are important for successful planning of experiments they should, however, be kept broad, in order not to create undue oppositions to new ideas. Flexibility should be maintained by not defining intermediate steps in detail and by trying alternate options and routes. Identifying and solving problems at early phase fosters momentum, confidence and identity towards novel approaches. Furthermore, sufficient amount of information about the project and progress should be offered in order managers to follow and realise the work performed. \citep{quinn1985managing}

Furthermore, small teams tend to handle communication and commitment among team members better, while as few management layers as possible decreases the jeopardy of rejection \citep{quinn1985managing}. Routine work should encourage information exchange, allow feedback and through trustworthy culture decrease defensiveness \citep{argyris1994good}. By promoting open communication, idea and ongoing information exchange with internal and external team members as well as encouraging information seeking from different perspectives and sources is likely to enhance creativity \citep{ancona1992demography,dougherty1996sustained}. In addition, experimenting and sharing ideas and information in as early stage of development process as possible and throughout the process remain essential \citep{thomke2001enlightened}. 
  
According to \citet{thomke2003r} experimenting requires openness for constant changes in practices and processes and \citet{shalley2004leaders} state how organisational and team structures and hierarchies affect on innovation and experimenting. Relationship between formal reporting and responsibility levels are essential: highly bureaucratic organisation discourage employees to reach for novel approaches and experiments, whereas organisation with flatter structure may enhance employees' autonomy and creativity. Employees may be likely to perceive presentations of organisations structure and hierarchy as discouraging and only highlighting how employees are not allowed or encouraged to make decisions on their own. This leads to less enthusiasm for trying out new ways of working and developing. In addition, heavy bureaucracy demanding lot of time and effort from employees to get novel ideas forward in the organisation is likely to destroy the enthusiasm of employees. \citep{shalley2004leaders}

The amount of experiments at the same time and place should be considered. Simultaneous experimenting keeps the learning speed high, whereas sequential experimenting is likely to delay the overall process. However, too many experiments conducted at the same place may increase the amount of surrounding noise and affect the results of experiments. Thus, capacity and amount of experiments need to be managed. \citep{thomke2003r} Overall, according to \citet{amabile2008creativity} constant experimenting should be the goal of working until sufficiently is learnt from the process and desired product or service. 

\citet{lee2004mixed} have studied the inconsistencies that are likely to inhibit experimentation behaviour. Where current research claims how affecting on one organisational condition is likely to foster behaviour essential for innovation, this approach reveals how changing only one organisational condition may lead to inconsistency between work tasks and expectations and lead to decrease in willingness to act towards innovation. Example of inconsistency in organisational conditions can be found from the behaviour of Bank of America's management levels. In order to show support for essential failure and to communicate how novel ideas are not able to rise without it, senior management set the failure rate in 30 per cent. This was supposed to indicate sufficient risk taking and novelty. Concurrently, rewards and employee compensation remained to be based on traditional measures of performance. This lead to inconsistency: the aim to increase innovation and novel ideas was contradictory to the reward system. If an employee spent a lot of time and effort on experimenting and faced failures, his rewards were likely to suffer. \citep{lee2004mixed} 

\section{Leadership behaviour}
Managerial practices for technological innovations have been widely studied, and many innovation researchers have stated leadership behaviour playing major role as a factor affecting innovation ability of organisations \citep{buijs2007innovation,jung2003role,jung2001transformational,amabile1998kill,mumford1988creativity} as well as employees' creative capabilities \citep{mumford2002leading,jung2001transformational,amabile1998kill,hennessey19881}. 

According to \citet{jung2003role} leaders are able to affect both directly and indirectly in their employees' and company's ability to innovate. For instance, empowering employees and building organisational climate optimal for innovation refers to indirect affecting. Understanding of individual's creativity and ways to influence and improve it gives managers guidelines when creating an environment and leadership that support organisational innovation and experimenting \citep{redmond1993putting}. 

A leader can have an affect on employee's level of creativity through leadership behaviours such as problem construction, learning goals and feelings of self-efficacy \citet{redmond1993putting}. As leaders play a major role in establishing, influencing and shaping organisational culture and climate through their communicated values and beliefs, they are able to shape the organisational culture into more innovative direction and foster creativity and experimentation in an organisation \citep{jung2003role,schein2010organizational} for instance by nurturing organisational climate that supports creative efforts and learning \citep{yukl2002leadership}. According to \citet{quinn1985managing} the essence lays in accepting the chaos of development and focusing on early prototyping and iteration. 

Following subsections describe in more detail how leaders can affect experimentation behaviour of employees by creating safe and supporting environment, acting as a role model and allowing sufficient resources for experimentation. 

\subsection{Creating safe and supporting environment}
Employees are more likely to conduct experiments in a psychologically safe environment described in section \ref{psychologicalsafety} and leaders have a great role in creating an ideal environment for experimenting \citep{quinn1985managing}. Leaders can decrease the fear of failure, motivate, define goals and focus as well as show support for employees. These aspects are outlined next. 

\subsubsection*{Decreasing fear of failure}
As described in section \ref{failures}, employees are not likely to take interpersonal risks when a leader acts in authoritarian or punitive ways, and responses to questions or challenges in defensive manner \citep{edmondson1999psychological}. In order to decrease the fear of failure and risk-taking, \citet{amabile2008creativity} and \citet{amabile1996assessing} suggest leaders should emphasise how constant experimenting requires failing early and often and through iterations learning is possible. Furthermore, speaking out loud ideas or making mistakes should not result in punishment or humiliation, and leaders should act in supporting and coach-oriented manner \citep{edmondson1999psychological}. Overall, training and coaching seem to be useful approaches for leaders, who pursue to contribute employee's self-efficacy and team effectiveness essential for experimenting \citep{amabile1998kill}. 

However, showing employees the support and tools for failing fast and early remain challenging \citep{farson2002failuretolerantleader}. Bank of America's top management serves an example how management level can show their support and commitment towards experimentation process. When setting up an experimentation laboratory in some of their banks in order to test ideas in real environment, some employees were afraid of their rewards and bonus scores getting harmed as a consequence of failed experiments. This decreased the willingness to experiment novel approaches. Senior management decided to abandon the conventional bonus system in the test branches, and instead reward employees based on team performance. This lead employees feel they were special and being supported in experimenting. \citep{thomke2003r}

\subsubsection*{Defining goals and focus for employees}
According to \citet{barczak1989leadership} leader's task is to provide clear focus for the work of employees. Oftentimes requesting creative and innovative solutions may lead to more creative results of individuals \citep{amabile2002creativity}. According to \citet{hackman1987design} setting directions and goals to employees also influences positively on team effectiveness.

As undertaking novel approaches to work oftentimes involves risk-concerned decision-making, employees should be offered decent level of guidance, goals and some measure of structure \citep{jung2003role}. Also \citet{redmond1993putting} states how leadership plays a major role in defining group goals, controlling resources and providing rewards through interactive leadership process. Leader not taking an active role in supporting and guiding the work of his employees may lead to organisational units working at cross-purpose. \citep{jung2003role} However, according to \citet{mumford2002leading} leaders' planning and guidance should focus on progress, projects on general level and implementation of the results of projects instead of focusing on offering detailed guidance on piece of work. 

Local leaders are in essential role in directing and evaluating work of employees, facilitating and allowing resources and information as well as encouraging employees to engage with the tasks and team members. \citep{amabile2004leader} Supporting actions include defining and setting appropriate goals and tasks \citet{amabile1998kill}, showing the work group support and confidence within the organisation, showing appreciation of individuals contributions to the project, focusing on efficient and good communication, and listening novel ideas with open mind. \citep{amabile2004leader} 

\subsubsection*{Motivating employees}
Creativity, exchanging ideas and turning them into action requires intrinsic motivation from employees \citep{jung2001transformational}, and according to \citet{amabile1998kill} leaders should foster organisational culture in which individuals find their motivation in divergent thinking and experimenting new ways of performing tasks. Furthermore, fear of failure is likely to be decreased through leadership that fosters the culture of intrinsic motivation, rewards from creative endeavours, idea exchange and open discussion \citet{amabile1998kill}. According to \citet{sosik1999leadership} leaders should concentrate on vision of work and its outcomes that is meaningful and motivational enough to inspire employees.

Also \citet{amabile2004leader} emphasise in their componential theory on creativity the support of immediate supervisors as a way to enhance employee's creativity and intrinsic motivation, which also affects employees willingness to conduct experiments. 

Leaders can affect employees' creativity and innovation skills both directly and indirectly \citep{jung2003role}. By stimulating employee's intrinsic motivation and higher level needs leaders are able to affect directly on employees' creativity \citep{tierney1999examination}, where indirect way may be through establishing a work environment where new ways of doing are encouraged and failure is not being punished \citep{amabile1996assessing}. Leaders who create and support a reward-system that values creative performance, provides both intrinsic and extrinsic rewards for employee's efforts to learn new skills and to challenge status quo by experimenting new approaches, increase employees' willingness to constantly engage in creative endeavours \citep{jung2001transformational,mumford1988creativity}.

Offering and receiving valuable feedback serves as a key function of leaders and one of the most challenging tasks they have, that has its affects on employees willingness to conduct experiments \citep{amabile2004leader,amabile1998kill}. According to \citet{shalley2004leaders} giving performance feedback is essential for creativity and accordingly difficult: creativity often involves approaching problems from new approaches, concurrently experimenting novel things includes risk-taking. 

\subsubsection*{Showing support}
Empowering employees is an essential tasks of leaders, through which a work environment is created where employees desire to seek innovative approaches to perform their work tasks \citep{jung2003role}. Transformational leaders encourage employees to participate in developing by highlighting the importance of cooperation, providing the opportunity to learn from shared experience and allowing employees to perform necessary actions in order to be more effective\citep{bass1990implications}. 

Idea generation is an essential phase of experimentation process.  Leaders need to acquire resources, encourage idea generation \citep{mcgourty1996managing} and support employees to break routines by stating how essential experimenting, iterating and failing is for learning and developing \citep{amabile2008creativity,shalley2004leaders}. Leaders supporting new ideas and idea exchange has been related to enhancing creativity especially among those employees who showed disposition towards creativity \citep{oldham1996employee}.  Leaders should create an environment where idea generation is possible \citep{andrews1970social}. This is likely through leaders who support and encourage employees, provide them autonomy in decision-making and everyday tasks, and communicate openly with employees \citep{oldham1996employee,tierney1999examination}. 

Also \citet{mumford2002leading} introduces idea generation and safe environment for ideas to emerge as essential tasks for leaders to support. Idea generation can be enhance by idea stimulation, education of various problem solving techniques, support for novel ideas, involving employees in developing ideas and allowing them freely pursue ideas. In addition to idea generation, idea structuring phase consists of creating action or project frameworks so that employee's have as much autonomy to perform the task as needed. (ibid)

\citet{buijs2007innovation} states how leaders dealing with uncertain and new innovations should stay certain about uncertainties and provide a safe environment and encourage employees to work on current task comfortably. Thus, high level of tolerance for dealing with different states of minds and various personal feelings is required from a leader. \citep{buijs2007innovation} According to \citet{mumford2002leading} essential element of safe environment includes a leader being in charge of conflict management.

However, in addition to contextual factors and environment, studies show level of support, control and assist an employee needs depends on personal characteristics. Thus, leaders knowing and understanding their employees is essential in order to provide employees sufficient support. \citep{shalley2004leaders}

\subsection{Role-modelling}
According to \citet{mumford2002leading} experimentation requires special leadership style. General leadership styles and practices are set for industrial management, whereas at present the focus should be on leading the people in a collaborative way, from authoritarian style to increased autonomy and trust. Furthermore, conventional models of leadership are not likely to encourage employees to challenge the status quo but to achieve required goals. (ibid) This change from authority-based leadership to collaboration with employees has occurred in literature and in practice \citep{amabile2008creativity,farson2002failuretolerantleader}. 

Team member's collective view of support they get from their leader has been related to the team's creative endeavours and success in them \citep{amabile1998kill,amabile1996assessing}. In order to encourage creativity and experimenting in teams, leaders should lead by example and act as role models. Leaders should consider their own behaviour and actions in a way that stimulates employees to new and innovative, creative approaches to problems. \citep{mumford2002leading,amabile2008creativity,waldman1990adding} \citet{katz1978social} refer to role of the leader in a sense where leader defines by his example the reality of workplace; norms, practices and culture. According to \citet{mumford2002leading} leaders acting as role models is essential element of safe environment.  

Through the green light given and their own example leaders can change the focus from success and failure into thinking in terms of learning and experience. \citep{farson2002failuretolerantleader} Also \citet{amabile2004leader} consider leader being a role model for employees essential for enhancing employee's creativity and intrinsic motivation. 

By defining organisational culture, climate and group norms leaders shape the way of working of employees. Through such role-modelling and mentoring process leaders also show employees how tasks are performed. Employees, in turn, follow the example of a leader in order to achieve high level performance. \citep{redmond1993putting} Role-modelling stands also as powerful tool for opening employee's eyes and attitudes to new perspectives, thinking 'out of the box' and adopting generative and exploratory thinking processes \citep{jung2003role,sternberg1997creativity} influencing creativity of an employee \citep{shalley2004leaders}. 

Changing overall organisational climate is challenging, yet various components are reasonably manageable and should foster creativity. For instance, risk-taking and constructive feedback can be supported through role modelling of the management. \citep{shalley2004leaders} Team members observe and reflect other members responses and actions and attend to them, yet behaviour of the leader is often their particular concern \citep{tyler1992relational}. In addition to supporting idea generation, leaders need to commit to the experimentation process by evaluating employees' ideas and integrating them to organisational needs \citep{mumford2002leading}.

\citet{farson2002failuretolerantleader} define a concept of failure-tolerant leader, who puts effort on explaining to employees how essential failure is for the development process as a whole, and how actual failing refers to a point where surprising, failed outcomes are not reflected and further analysed in order to learn. Performing accordingly, admitting own failures and not chasing anyone to blame, failure-tolerant leaders encourage failure, lower the threshold and ease the fear of failing of employees. \citep{farson2002failuretolerantleader}

Furthermore, failure-tolerant leaders treat success and failure similarly, analysing and reflecting the outcomes in order to grow the intellectual capital of the team, including experience, knowledge and creativity. Other characteristics of failure-tolerant leaders are being rather collaborative than controlling, listening carefully, seeing the bigger picture, asking questions and focusing on the development and future rather than blaming on mistakes. In addition, in order to gain empathy and trust among employees, leader should admit their own mistakes, as it shows self-confidence and honesty, assisting in forming closer ties with employees. Vulnerability and transparency play a major role in trustworthy relationship between leader and employees.  \citep{farson2002failuretolerantleader}

\subsection{Allowing resources}
Top management and immediate superiors can affect and support employees' experimentation behaviour by allowing different resources experimentation requires. The most urgent resources are time for creative thinking and experimenting, material resources and autonomy over employee's own work. \citet{amabile2008creativity,katz1985project}. 

Prior studies show how creative efforts of employees require remarkably time and energy \citep{gardner1988creativity,getzels1975problem}, big ideas do not hatch overnight. Furthermore, trying out novel approaches and conducting experiments require more energy and is overall more challenging for employees than performing and sticking to the routine tasks. As it takes more cognitive resources to generate several alternative solutions, practice divergent thinking and approach problems from different perspectives, allowing time for creative work and thinking is essential \citep{amabile2002creativity,shalley2004leaders}. According to a study of \citet{amabile2002creativity}, employees working on high time pressure affects negatively on ability to engage in creative cognitive processing. In addition, analytic and creative thinking are prevented under stress, heavy workload and too tight schedule and ability to recognise and react to problems and learn from experiences deteriorates \citep{garvin2008yours}.

Thus, clear time should be allocated for developing especially when the aim is to flourish idea generation, creativity, learning and experimentation of new concepts \citep{amabile2002creativity,redmond1993putting,amabile1987creativit}. However, no sense of urgency leads employees easily to auto-pilot mode, in which routine tasks are performed without further thinking and analysing \citep{amabile2002creativity}. 

\citet{katz1985project} found in their study how uninterrupted time was considered critical for engineers working on novel technologies. Indeed, lack of time and resources may serve as a hindrance to employee's willingness to take risks and perform experiments \citep{jung2003role}. Through leaders who allow their employees to participate in developing and ideating, reserve budget for it and set it as a part of performance standard, the hindrance for risk-taking may be lowered \citep{jung2003role}.
 
Furthermore, leaders can assist their employees by recognising times with high pressure, and allowing employees to focus on certain thing at a time, leaving the expectations of creativity and new ideas into the future endeavours, when time pressure has decreased. On the other hand, if creativity is required under stress, leader should transparently explain the importance and reasons behind the strict schedule and required goals. Thus an employee may relate to the problem at hand and engage better at his work. Indeed, helping people to understand the importance of work is essential especially under high time pressure. \citep{amabile2002creativity}

Autonomy and freedom to perform essential tasks has major effects on organisational creativity, as individuals are more likely to produce creative work when having the feeling of personal control over how to approach given tasks \citep{amabile1996assessing,shalley2004leaders}. Furthermore, allowing employees freedom to act actually arouses desire to act \citep{kanter1983change}. Yet, in order to maintain organisational innovation and risk-taking, autonomy given to an employee can not be in contradiction with fear of failure or discouragement towards challenging status quo or trying out novel solutions \citep{yukl2002leadership}. 

Furthermore, too much autonomy, meaning full control over planning and conducting the work and experiments, may lead to negative consequences and contradictory goals between employee and organisation. \citep{shalley2004leaders} Thus, setting appropriate goals and understandable requirements that inspire employees is essential. Furthermore, leaders need to realise whether the goals require creativity or lead to creative outcomes, and not anticipate creativity or creative outcomes and instead accept employees being less creative where it is not needed. (ibid)

Organisational structures affect in the traditional roles of leadership as a means of direct responsibility given to employees. The trend of flatter organisations provides more autonomy to employees, whereas leaders' role transforms to more involved in external resource acquisition and managing the interfaces. \citep{shalley2004leaders} Also according to \citet{amabile2008creativity}  much success rises from employees' own initiatives, which results from wide amount of autonomy at work. \citep{amabile2008creativity} 

Leaders task to promote ideas and results of experiments to upper levels of organisation serve as a major way to insure sufficient resources and support for the idea implementation. \citep{mumford2002leading}  

In order to be creative and conduct experiments sufficient access to material resources should be allowed for employees \citep{katz1985project}. However, even though material resources are essential for creativity, studies have suggested a contradictory perspective: when employees have access to wide range of material resources, their creativity tendencies may decrease. This may happen due to the creative actions and thoughts an employee needs to perform when needing certain resources to finish his task but not having them at hand. This, in a way, stretches employees' skills to think differently and achieve goals. \citep{csikszentmihalyi199916} Thus, \citet{csikszentmihalyi199916} states how resources are likely to make employees feel too comfortable and lead to decrease in creativity. 

Under some circumstances, according to \citet{monge1992communication} group communication is likely to increase innovation. Thus, leaders should consider managing wide range of formal and informal meetings and facilitated discussions in order to create opportunities for ideation. Furthermore, innovation occurs over time and is a dynamic process. Leaders should be sensitive in which pace more managerial impact is needed, and in which pace of the process more freedom and autonomy should be allowed for employees. \citep{monge1992communication} 

When brought to wider scale of innovations, a company desiring for innovation should allocate resources and define long-term goals and actions accordingly. Even though companies urge to invest most resources in current lines, sufficient resources should be allocated for long-term growth and innovation. This includes providing an environment strong enough to seize surprising opportunities and tolerate unforeseen threats in all organisational, technical and external relations levels. \citep{quinn1985managing} 

\section{Summary}
The aim for this chapter was to from a consensus on current research concerning factors affecting experimentation behaviour. As experimentation has not yet been widely studied, research from innovation and creativity were included together with organisational behaviour and leadership research.

Psychological safe environment resonates well with the environment aimed for experimenting. In psychologically safe environment employees do not fear being rejected, ask naive questions, make mistakes or present viewpoint of minority. In contrast, psychologically safe environment enables employees comfortably express their thoughts at work. Appreciation of differences is important, as opening minds for different ideas and world views increases both energy and motivation, brings out fresh thinking and are all essential for experimentation behaviour. \citep{garvin2008yours} 

When developing novel products and processes, iteration and failure are included, employees need to feel safe to try various approaches and fail \citep{shalley2004leaders}. As discussed earlier, organisational culture has great influence on employee's perception of safe environment for failing. Employees should be encouraged in risk-taking, exploring and testing uncertain approaches \citep{garvin2008yours}. As failures bring most value to the process, it should be encouraged \citep{thomke2001enlightened} and considered as an opportunity for learning and growth \citep{farson2002failuretolerantleader}. 

In order truly novel things to emerge through experimenting and employees to learn and engage to their work, top management and leaders should allocate creative time for playing with ideas, brainstorming, learning and experimenting \citep{amabile2002creativity}. Additionally, employees should be provided with sufficient access to material resources \citep{katz1985project} and autonomy on experimentation \citep{shalley2004leaders}. 

Creative thinking and actions require time, and contradictory, in fast-paced and rapidly changing world and working environment managers should allocate employees sufficient time for creative thinking and experimenting novel approaches \citep{shalley2004leaders}.

When combining routine work and innovative experimenting, needs to be noticed that the threat for inconsistencies and causing confusion to employees rises. Thus, creativity, learning and experimentation and their dynamics should be understood as well as the consequences inconsistent signals and requirements may lead to \citep{lee2004mixed}.
